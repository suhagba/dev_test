# Software developer coding test

This repository is a test to be done by job candidates applying for the software developer position at EMU.

This test is written with the intent that it should take ~3 hours to complete. It contains many small questions, such that getting any one question wrong isn't that big of a deal. If you can't complete a question then make a best effort and move on: any comments explaining what you attempted to do and why you got stuck are appreciated.

A lot of these questions are written with the assumption that you may need to search with Google to help you get an answer.

The answers to some of these questions are subjective and there can be multiple correct ways to answer.

There are seven parts to this test:

- Project setup and version control
- General Python
- Performance improvements
- Testing code
- Mathematical modelling
- Cloud computing
- Web development

You might not be an expert in all of these things, and that's ok (neither am I), just do your best.
